# 5.1 Advanced Variables

[Variables](../glossary#variable) in Robot Framework, and in programming languages in general, can be more complex and can store various types of data.
Robot Framework also offers multiple ways to create different kinds of values and types.
However, the built-in language support is limited to the basic [3.2.2.2 Primitive Data Types](chapter-03/02_variables.md#3222-primitive-data-types), [3.2.2.3 List Variable Definition](chapter-03/02_variables.md#3223-list-variable-definition), and [3.2.2.4 Dictionary Variable Definition](chapter-03/02_variables.md#3224-dictionary-variable-definition).


This chapter provides more advanced knowledge about the different [variable scopes](../glossary#[variable](../glossary#variable)-scope), lists, dictionaries, their syntax, and some background on the most important [Built-In Variables](../glossary#built-in-variables).

Understanding the **priority** and **scope** of [variables](../glossary#variable) in Robot Framework is crucial for effective [test](../glossary#test-case) automation.
[Variables](../glossary#variable) can be defined in multiple places and ways, and their availability and precedence depend on where and how they are created.



## 5.1.1 Variable Priorities

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K2[LO-5.1.1]

Understand the difference between statically defined and dynamically created variables in Robot Framework

:::

::::

Variables can originate from various sources, and when variables with the same name exist,
Robot Framework resolves them based on their priority.

Several factors influence variable priority in Robot Framework: the type of [variable](../glossary#variable), the time of (re-)definition, and the [variable](../glossary#variable)’s scope.

In general, there are two types of variables regarding how they are created:
- Statically defined or imported variables (e.g., in the `*** Variables ***` section, command-line options, imported resource files)
- Dynamically created variables during Robot Framework execution (e.g., using the `VAR` syntax, assignment of return values from [keywords](../glossary#keyword) or [keyword](../glossary#keyword) arguments)

[Built-in variables](../glossary#built-in-variables) cannot generally be sorted into one of these categories, as some are predefined globally while others are created during execution with a `SUITE` or `TEST` scope.

Examples:
- `${TEST_NAME}` is dynamically set during execution to the name of the currently running [test case](../glossary#test-case).
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}` is statically defined before the execution and contains the directory where `output.xml`, `log.html` and `report.html` are written.
- `${LOG_LEVEL}` is by default set statically via command line options or `INFO` as default, but can be changed, with the [keyword](../glossary#keyword) `Set Log Level` during exection.

### 5.1.1.1 Statically Defined or Imported Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.1.1]

Recall the priority of statically defined or imported variables in Robot Framework

:::

::::

The rule of thumb here is: **"First come, first served!"**

The time of definition has the greatest impact on the priority of these variables.

In descending order, the priority is as follows:

1. **Global Command-Line Variables**: Variables defined via command-line options like `--variable` or `--variablefile` have the highest priority. See [5.1.3 Global Variables via Command Line](chapter-05/01_advanced_variables.md#513-global-variables-via-command-line) for more details.

2. **`*** Variables ***` Section**: Variables defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of a suite are set before any [resource file](../glossary#resource-file) from the `*** Settings ***` section is imported. See [3.2.2 `*** Variables ***` Section](chapter-03/02_variables.md#322--variables--section) for more details.

3. **Resource Files**: Variables from [resource files](../glossary#resource-file) are imported in the order they are specified in the `*** Settings ***` section. See [2.4.2 Resource Files](chapter-02/04_keyword_imports.md#242-resource-files) for more details.

   Within a [resource file](../glossary#resource-file), the same order applies: variables defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of a [resource file](../glossary#resource-file) have higher priority than variables imported from other [resource files](../glossary#resource-file).

However, variables defined during Robot Framework execution can overwrite or shadow these variables.


### 5.1.1.2 Dynamically Created Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.1.2]

Recall the priority of dynamically created variables in Robot Framework

:::

::::

Variables created or modified during execution have a higher priority than statically defined or imported variables.

The rule of thumb here is: **"Last one wins!"**

The scope of a variable defines its lifetime and availability.
As long as a variable is in scope, the last definition takes precedence over the previous ones.

For example, a [local variable](../glossary#local-variable) defined as a [3.3.5 User Keyword Arguments](chapter-03/03_user_keyword.md#335-user-keyword-arguments) has a higher priority than a [suite variable](../glossary#suite-variable) defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of the [suite file](../glossary#suite-file).
However, once the [keyword](../glossary#keyword) body scope is exited, the [suite variable](../glossary#suite-variable) is back in scope with higher priority and the [local variable](../glossary#local-variable) is no longer existent.


## 5.1.2 Variable Scopes

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.2]

Recall the different variable scopes in Robot Framework

:::

::::

Variables in Robot Framework have different scopes, determining where they can be accessed and how long they are available.

### 5.1.2.1 . Global Scope

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.2.1]

Recall how to define global variables and where they can be accessed

:::

::::

- **Definition**: Variables accessible everywhere during the [test](../glossary#test-case) execution.
- **Creation**:
  - Set from the command line using `--variable` or `--variablefile` options. (static)
  - Created during execution using the `VAR` syntax with the `scope=GLOBAL` [argument](../glossary#argument). (dynamic)
- **Usage**: Ideal for configuration parameters that need to be consistent across the entire [test](../glossary#test-case) run.

Because [global variables](../glossary#global-variable) set via the command line have the highest priority, they can override other variables defined in the suite or [resource files](../glossary#resource-file).
The most common use case for [global variables](../glossary#global-variable) is to define environment-specific or execution configurations, such as URLs, credentials, browser types, API keys, or similar data.

See [5.1.3 Global Variables via Command Line](chapter-05/01_advanced_variables.md#513-global-variables-via-command-line) for more details.

**Recommendation**:
[Global variables](../glossary#global-variable) should always be defined using uppercase letters, like `${GLOBAL_VARIABLE}`, to distinguish them from [local variables](../glossary#local-variable).
Every [global variable](../glossary#global-variable) should have a corresponding default value defined either in a `*** Variables ***` section or imported from [variable files](../glossary#variable-file), so that editors and IDEs can provide auto-completion and static code analysis.


### 5.1.2.2 . Suite Scope

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.2.2]

Recall how to define suite variables and where they can be accessed

:::

::::

- **Definition**: Variables accessible within the test suite where they are defined, including all its tests|[tasks](../glossary#task) and [keywords](../glossary#keyword).
- **Creation**:
  - Defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of the [suite file](../glossary#suite-file). (static)
  - Imported from resource or [variable files](../glossary#variable-file). (static)
  - Set during the execution of a suite using the `VAR` syntax with the `scope=SUITE` [argument](../glossary#argument). (dynamic)
- **Usage**: Useful for sharing data among tests/[tasks](../glossary#task) within the same suite or configuring suite-specific settings or setting default values for global variables.

Suite scope is not recursive; variables in a higher-level suite, e.g. defined in [4.3 Initialization Files](chapter-04/03_init_files.md), are not available in lower-level suites. Use resource files to share variables across suites.

Variables with a suite scope are generally statically defined or imported variables, but they can also be created dynamically during the execution of a suite. In this latter case, they have a higher priority than statically defined variables and can shadow or overwrite them.

If a variable is defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of a [suite file](../glossary#suite-file) and is dynamically defined using the `VAR` syntax at the suite level, the variable value is overwritten with the new value.

If a global variable is defined using the command line, and a suite-level variable with the same name is dynamically defined, the [suite variable](../glossary#suite-variable) now shadows the [global variable](../glossary#global-variable) and has higher priority as long as the suite is in scope. Once the suite is finished or a sub-suite is executed, the [global variable](../glossary#global-variable) returns to scope with higher priority.

**Recommendation**:
[Suite variables](../glossary#suite-variable) should be defined using uppercase letters, like `${SUITE_VARIABLE}`, to distinguish them from [local variables](../glossary#local-variable). These variables should be defined in the `*** Variables ***` section of the suite file, even if they are dynamically overwritten during execution, so they are visible in the editor or IDE and can be used for auto-completion and static code analysis.

### 5.1.2.3 . Test|Task Scope

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.2.3]

Recall how to define test|task variables and where they can be accessed

:::

::::

- **Definition**: Variables accessible within a single test|[task](../glossary#task) and within all [keywords](../glossary#keyword) it calls.
- **Creation**:
  - Created during test execution using the `VAR` syntax with the `scope=TEST` or `scope=TASK` [argument](../glossary#argument). (dynamic)
- **Usage**: Appropriate for data that is specific to a single test|[task](../glossary#task).

Test|[Task](../glossary#task) variables cannot be created in [suite setup](../glossary#suite-setup) or teardown, nor can they be imported. Test|Task scope variables are not available in other tests|[tasks](../glossary#task), even within the same suite.
They can only be created dynamically, so they have higher priority than suite or global variables while in scope.
Once a test|task is finished, the variables are no longer available. If they have shadowed a suite or global variable, that variable returns to scope.

**Recommendation**:
Test|Task variables should be used only when there is a clear need to share data across multiple keywords within a single test|task and when this is known by all team members.
Otherwise, it is better to use [local variables](../glossary#local-variable). Editor and IDE support for these variables is limited, so they should be used with caution.


### 5.1.2.4 . Local Scope

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.2.4]

Recall how to define local variables and where they can be accessed

:::

::::

- **Definition**: Variables accessible only within the keyword or test|task where they are defined.
- **Creation**:
  - Variables assigned by keyword return values.
  - Variables defined using the `VAR` syntax (optional: with `scope=LOCAL`) within a keyword or test|task.
  - Keyword [arguments](../glossary#argument).
- **Usage**: Commonly used to temporarily store data and pass it to other keywords.

Local variables are the most commonly used variables in Robot Framework and have the fewest side effects. They should be preferred over other [variable scopes](../glossary#variable-scope) unless there is an explicit need to share data across scope boundaries.

**Recommendation**:
Local variables should always be defined using lowercase letters, like `${local_variable}`, to distinguish them from other variables.

**Example of local variables**:

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Test People In Room
    ${trainer_count}    Get Trainers In Room    # returns the integer 2
    ${trainee_count}    Get Trainees In Room    # returns the integer 12
    ${total_people}    Calculate Sum    ${trainer_count}    ${trainee_count}
    Should Be Equal As Numbers    ${total_people}    14

*** Keywords ***
Calculate Sum
    [Arguments]    ${num1}    ${num2}
    ${result}    Evaluate    ${num1} + ${num2}
    RETURN    ${result}
```

In this example, the variable `${trainer_count}` is only available in the [test case](../glossary#test-case) itself and not in the keyword `Calculate Sum`.
Therefore, its value has to be passed as an argument to `Calculate Sum`, which assigns the value stored in `${trainer_count}` to the [local variable](../glossary#local-variable) `${num1}` within `Calculate Sum`.
Additionally, `${result}` is only available within `Calculate Sum`, and only its value is returned to the [test case](../glossary#test-case), where it is assigned to `${total_people}`.



## 5.1.3 Global Variables via Command Line

As described earlier, global variables can be statically defined via command-line options.

The command line option `--variable` or `-v` can be used to define global variables.
This option can be used multiple times to define multiple variables.
The syntax is `--variable name:value` where `name` is the variable name without `${}` and `value` is the assigned value.

Only scalar string values are supported.

**Examples:**

- Simple String: `${name}` == `Robot` (str)
    ```shell
    robot --variable name:Robot .
    ```

- String with Spaces: `${hello}` == `Hello world` (str)
    ```shell
    robot -v "hello:Hello world" .
    ```

- Multiple Variables: `${name}` == `Robot` (str), `${version}` == `4.0` (str), `${patch}` == `${EMPTY}`    ```shell
    robot -v "name:Robot Framework" -v version:4.0 -v patch: .
    ```



## 5.1.4 List-Variables (Advanced)

As explained in the `*** Variables ***` section under [3.2.2.3 List Variable Definition](chapter-03/02_variables.md#3223-list-variable-definition), Robot Framework natively supports creating lists.
However, the at-syntax `@{var}` has different meanings when assigning values versus accessing values.


### 5.1.4.1 Assigning List Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.4.1]

Recall that assignments to `@{list}` variables convert values to lists automatically

:::

::::

Using the at-syntax (`@{}`) is required to define a [list variable](../glossary#list-variable) with `VAR` syntax or in the `*** Variables ***` section, but it is optional when assigning return values, which are list-like, from keywords to a variable.

Example:

```robotframework
*** [Test Cases](../glossary#test-case) ***
Test [List Variables](../glossary#list-variable)    @{participants}    Get Participants                 # returns a list of names
    ${trainers}        Get Trainers                     # returns a list of trainers
```

Both assignments will contain a list if the keyword returns a list of values.

However, if a keyword returns something other than a list but still list-like, it will be assigned without changes to the [scalar variable](../glossary#scalar-variable) `${trainers}` and will be converted to a list when using the at-syntax, as in `@{participants}`.
List-like values can include Tuples, Sets, Dictionary Keys, or generator functions.
As long as a value is iterable, it can be assigned to a list variable using the at-syntax to ensure it is a list after assignment.

**Note**: Strings are iterable in Python; however, they are explicitly **NOT** converted to a list when assigned to a list variable to prevent mistakes.

### 5.1.4.2 Accessing List Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.4.2]

Recall that `@{list}` unpacks the values of a list variable when accessed

:::

::::

Variables containing a list are generally accessed with the normal dollar-syntax `${var}`.
You can also access single values within a list using `${var}[0]` or `${var}[-1]`, and Robot Framework supports slicing, similar to Python, with `${var}[1:3]` or `${var}[1:]`.

However, in some cases, it is necessary to unpack the values of a list variable to use them as a sequence of multiple individual values. This is done using the at-syntax `@{var}` when accessing the variable.
Unpacking works for iterable values, but is NOT possible with strings!

Example:

```robotframework
*** Variables ***
@{participants}    Alice    Bob    Charlie


*** [Test Cases](../glossary#test-case) ***
Test [List Variables](../glossary#list-variable)
    Log Many    Alice    Bob    Charlie    # Logs three entries:    "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie"
    Log Many    @{participants}            # Logs three entries:    "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie"
    Log Many    ${participants}            # Logs only one entry:   "['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']"
```

In the first two cases, the keyword `Log Many` is called with three arguments; in the last case, it is called with only one argument, which is a list of three values.

This is particularly needed when using FOR-Loops. See [5.2.4 FOR Loops](chapter-05/02_control_structures.md#524-for-loops) for more details.



## 5.1.5 Dict-Like

As explained in the `*** Variables ***` section under [3.2.2.4 Dictionary Variable Definition](chapter-03/02_variables.md#3224-dictionary-variable-definition), Robot Framework natively supports creating dictionaries.
However, the ampersand-syntax `&{var}` has different meanings when assigning values and when accessing values.


### 5.1.5.1 Assigning Dictionary Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.5.1]

Recall that assignments to `&{dict}` variables automatically convert values to Robot Framework Dictionaries and enable dot-access

:::

::::

Using the ampersand-syntax (`&{}`) is required to define a dictionary variable with `VAR` syntax or in the `*** Variables ***` section, but it is optional when assigning return values from keywords to a variable that returns dictionaries.

Example:

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Test Dictionary Variables
    &{participant}   Get Participant   number=4   # returns a dictionary with keys "name" and "age"
    ${trainer}       Get Trainer       number=1   # returns a dictionary with keys "name" and "age"
```

In the following example, the first assignment to `&{participant}` causes an automatic conversion to a Robot Framework Dictionary, also known as DotDict. These special dictionary types can be accessed using dot-access like `${participant.name}` or `${participant.age}`, instead of the usual dictionary access like `${trainer}[name]` or `${trainer}[age]`.


### 5.1.5.2 Accessing Dictionary Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.5.2]

Recall that `&{dict}` unpacks to multiple key=value pairs when accessed

:::

::::

Variables containing dictionaries are typically accessed using the normal dollar-syntax `${var}`.
You can also access individual values by their keys using `${var}[key]` or `${var.key}` for Robot Framework Dictionaries.

However, in some cases, it is useful to unpack the key-value pairs of a dictionary variable to use them as a sequence of multiple key-value pairs. This is done using the ampersand-syntax `&{var}` when accessing the variable.

Example:

```robotframework
*** Variables ***
&{participant_one}    name=Alice    age=23
&{participant_two}    name=Bob      age=42

*** Test Cases ***
Test Dictionary Variables
    Log Participant    John    33
    Log Participant    name=Pekka    age=44
    Log Participant    &{participant_one}
    Log Participant    &{participant_two}

*** Keywords ***
Log Participant
    [Arguments]    ${name}    ${age}
    Log    ${name} is ${age} years old
```

Instead of calling the keyword `Log Participant` with two arguments, it is possible to use the unpacked dictionary variables `&{participant_one}` and `&{participant_two}` to call the keyword with two [named arguments](../glossary#named-argument).
The dictionary keys act as the argument names and the values as the argument values.



## 5.1.6 Built-In Variables

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-5.1.6]

Recall that Robot Framework provides access to execution information via Built-In variables

:::

::::

Robot Framework has a set of built-in variables that can be used in [test cases](../glossary#test-case), keywords, and other places. Some examples are:

| Variable           | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `${EMPTY}`         | An empty string.                                                                                                                                               |
| `${SPACE}`         | A single space character.                                                                                                                                      |
| `${CURDIR}`        | An absolute path to the directory where the current suite or resource file is located. This variable is case-sensitive.                                        |
| `${EXECDIR}`       | An absolute path to the directory where test execution was started from.                                                                                       |
| `${OUTPUT_DIR}`    | An absolute path to the directory where output files, like `output.xml`, `log.html`, and `report.html`, are written.                                           |
| `${TEMPDIR}`       | An absolute path to the system temporary directory. In UNIX-like systems, this is typically `/tmp`, and in Windows, it is `c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Temp`. |

Additionally, suite-related or test|task-related variables are available. These variables can have different values during test execution, and some are not available at all times. Altering the value of these variables does not affect the original values.

| Variable                 | Description                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `${SUITE_NAME}`          | The name of the current suite.                 |
| `${SUITE_SOURCE}`        | The path to the file where the current suite is defined. |
| `${SUITE_DOCUMENTATION}` | The documentation of the current suite.        |
| `${TEST_NAME}`           | The name of the current test.                  |
| `${TEST_DOCUMENTATION}`  | The documentation of the current test.         |
| `${PREV_TEST_STATUS}`    | The status of the previous test.               |

These variables can be used in test cases, keywords, and other places to access information about the current test execution.
