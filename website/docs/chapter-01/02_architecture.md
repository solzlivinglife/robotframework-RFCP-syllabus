# 1.2 Architecture of Robot Framework

Robot Framework is an open-source automation framework that allows you to build [automation scripts](../glossary#automation-script) for testing and [RPA](../glossary#robotic-process-automation) (Robotic Process Automation).
It focuses on providing a [keyword](../glossary#keyword)-driven or behavior-driven approach, making the automation easy to understand and maintain.
However, it is not a full-stack solution that encompasses all layers of automation.
Instead, it provides a flexible platform where different tools, libraries, and integrations handle specific [tasks](../glossary#task) to implement a flexible automation solution.



## 1.2.1 Robot Framework and the gTAA (Generic Test Automation Architecture)

:::K1[LO-1.2.1]

Recall the layers of the Generic Test Automation Architecture (gTAA) and their corresponding components in Robot Framework

:::

::::

The **Generic [Test](../glossary#test-case) Automation Architecture (gTAA)** described in the ISTQB "Certified Tester Advanced Level [Test](../glossary#test-case) Automation Engineering" offers a structured approach to [test](../glossary#test-case) automation, dividing it into different layers for a clear separation of concerns:

- **Definition Layer**: This layer contains the "[Test Data](../glossary#test-data)" ([test cases](../glossary#test-case), [tasks](../glossary#task), [resource files](../glossary#resource-file) which include [user keywords](../glossary#user-keyword) and variables).
In Robot Framework, the [test data](../glossary#test-data) is written using the defined syntax and contains [keyword](../glossary#keyword) calls and [argument](../glossary#argument) values that make the [test case](../glossary#test-case) or [task](../glossary#task) definitions structured in suites.

- **Execution Layer**: In Robot Framework, the [execution layer](../glossary#execution-layer) consists of the framework itself, including its core components and APIs.
It parses and interprets the [test data](../glossary#test-data) syntax to build an [execution model](../glossary#execution-model).
The [execution layer](../glossary#execution-layer) is responsible for processing this [execution model](../glossary#execution-model) to execute the library [keywords](../glossary#keyword) with their [argument](../glossary#argument) values, logging results, and generating reports.

- **Adaptation Layer**: This layer provides the connection between Robot Framework and the system under test (SUT).
In Robot Framework, this is where the [keyword libraries](../glossary#keyword-library), which contain code responsible for interacting with different technologies and interfaces,
such as those for UI, API, database interactions, or others, are located.
These [keyword libraries](../glossary#keyword-library) enable interaction with different technologies and interfaces, ensuring the automation is flexible and adaptable to various environments.

Editors/IDEs that offer support for Robot Framework's syntax are tools that support or integrate in these layers.
When writing tests|[tasks](../glossary#task) or [keywords](../glossary#keyword), the editor supports the [definition layer](../glossary#definition-layer).
When executing or debugging tests|tasks, the editor supports the [execution layer](../glossary#execution-layer).
When writing [keywords](../glossary#keyword) in e.g. Python for [keyword libraries](../glossary#[keyword](../glossary#keyword)-library), the editor supports the [adaptation layer](../glossary#adaptation-layer).
Therefore also other additional extensions of Robot Framework can be categorized into these layers.

## 1.2.2 What is Robot Framework & What It Is Not

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-1.2.2]

Recall what is part of Robot Framework and what is not

:::

::::


Robot Framework itself focuses primarily on **test|[task](../glossary#task) execution**.
It includes:

- A parser to read test|[task](../glossary#task) data and build an [execution model](../glossary#execution-model).
- An execution engine to process model and execute the keywords.
- A result generation mechanism to provide logs and reports.
- A collection of generic standard libraries to process and handle data or interact with files and processes.
- Defined APIs for extensions and customizations.

However, Robot Framework **does not** include:

- Keyword libraries to control systems under test/[RPA](../glossary#robotic-process-automation).

  Such as:
  - Web front-end automation libraries.
  - API interaction libraries.
  - Mobile automation libraries.
  - Database interaction libraries.
  - [RPA](../glossary#robotic-process-automation) libraries.
  - etc.

- Code editors or IDEs.
- CI/CD Integration.

Robot Framework defines the syntax for test|task data, but it is the role of external libraries and tools to extend its functionality for specific automation needs.



## 1.2.3 Technology & Prerequisites

::::lo[Learning Objectives]

:::K1[LO-1.2.3]

Recall the technology Robot Framework is built on and the prerequisites for running it

:::

::::


Robot Framework is built on **Python** but is adaptable to other languages and technologies through external libraries.
To run Robot Framework, an [officially supported version](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) of the **Python interpreter** is required on the machine executing the tests|tasks.
Typically, Robot Framework and its libraries are installed via the "package installer for Python" (`pip`) from [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/), allowing for straightforward installation and setup.
Robot Framework itself does not have any external dependencies, but additional third party tools or keyword libraries may require additional installations.
